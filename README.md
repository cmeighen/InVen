# InVen Personal Inventory System (WIP)

## Description
Inven was inspired by playing RPGs and wanting to have a way to organize and sort my own belongings. 

This project follows the React Redux pattern and uses LocalStorage to persist the state of the containers and items. 

Sass was installed to provide better styling functionality. 





This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/).
